3. The selection of resource group is very important.  A resource group
   is a container that holds related resources for an Azure
   solution. The resource group includes those resources that you want
   to manage as a group. You decide which resources belong in a resource
   group based on what makes the most sense for your organization.  If
   you have an existing resource group into which you want to deploy
   this solution, you may enter its name here, however the resource
   group must have no pre-existing resources in it.  Alternatively, you
   can click the "Create new" link and enter in the name so that Azure
   will create a new resource group before provisioning the resources.
   For more on resource groups see the [Azure
   documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview#resource-groups)
