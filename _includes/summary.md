The summary blade runs final validation checks and gives you the
opportunity to review the values before proceeding.  If the values look
good, you may click "OK".  

Alternatively, you can save the template aside by clicking on "Download
template and parameters".  This will take you to another part of the
Azure portal that lets you inspect the configuration file, called an ARM
template, that will actually cause the {{ site.data.var.wlsFullBrandName
}} to be provisioned into Azure.  For more on this and other ARM
template features in the Azure portal, see the [Azure
documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-quickstart-create-templates-use-the-portal).
To get back to the Summary pane, click on "Summary" in the bread crumbs
widget near the top of the page.
